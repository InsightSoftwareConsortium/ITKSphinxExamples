# Try Catch Exception

```{index} single: ExceptionObject
```

## Synopsis

Try and catch an `itk::ExceptionObject`. The exception is printed to console
output. This can provide more information when a program crashes, including
where the exception occurred and its description. Exceptions in ITK are
usually only thrown during calls to `->Update()`, so only the `->Update()`
call is added to the `try` block.

## Results

```none
ExceptionObject caught !
