# Do Data Parallel Threading

```{index} single: DomainThreader single: ThreadedIndexedContainerPartitioner
```

## Synopsis

In this example, we show how to do an operation on data across multiple threads to take advantage of multi-core processors.

In this example we have an `enum` of central nervous system cell types, a
`std::vector< CELL_TYPE >` that contains the cells that we have encountered, and
we want to count how many we have of each `CELL_TYPE`.

## Results

Output:

```
Result of the multi-threaded cell count:
      NEURON:          3
      ASTROCYTE:       5
      OLIGODENDROCYTE: 2
Result of the single-threaded cell count:
      NEURON:          3
      ASTROCYTE:       5
      OLIGODENDROCYTE: 2
```
