# Re-Run Pipeline With Changing Largest Possible Region

```{index} single: ProcessObject single: ImageSeriesReader single: pipeline
```

## Synopsis

Re-run a pipeline where the LargestPossibleRegion in the pipeline is expected to change on consecutive runs. The pipeline does not detect this condition, and it will throw an exception,

```
Requested region is (at least partially) outside the largest possible region.
```

In this case, an `UpdateLargestPossibleRegion()` call is required instead of `Update()`.

## Results

Output:

```
Initial LargestPossibleRegion: ImageRegion (0x7fff11257330)
Dimension: 3
Index: [0, 0, 0]
Size: [256, 256, 3]


Trying to call Update() after shrinking the LargestPossibleRegion...
