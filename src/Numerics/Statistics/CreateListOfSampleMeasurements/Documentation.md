# Create List of Sample Measurements

```{index} single: ListSample
```

## Synopsis

Create a lsit of sample measurements.

## Results

Output:

```
id = 0         measurement vector = [1, 2, 4]  frequency = 1
id = 1         measurement vector = [2, 4, 5]  frequency = 1
id = 2         measurement vector = [3, 8, 6]  frequency = 1
id = 0         measurement vector = [1, 2, 4]  frequency = 1
id = 1         measurement vector = [2, 4, 5]  frequency = 1
id = 2         measurement vector = [3, 8, 6]  frequency = 1
Size = 3
Total frequency = 3
