# Histogram Creation and Bin Access

```{index} single: Histogram
```

## Synopsis

This example shows how to create a `Histogram` object and use it.

We call an instance in a `Histogram` object a *bin*.
The Histogram differs from the {itkdox}`itk::Statistics::ListSample`,
{itkdox}`itk::Statistics::ImageToListSampleAdaptor`, or
{itkdox}`itk::Statistics::PointSetToListSampleAdaptor` in significant
ways.  Histograms can have a variable number of values (`unsigned
long` type) for each measurement vector, while the three other
classes have a fixed value (one) for all measurement vectors.  Also
those array-type containers can have multiple instances (data
elements) with identical measurement vector values. However, in a
Histogram object, there is one unique instance for any given
measurement vector.

Here we create a histogram with dense frequency containers.  In this
example we will not have any zero-frequency measurements, so the dense
frequency container is the appropriate choice.  If the histogram is
expected to have many empty (zero) bins, a sparse frequency container
would be the better option.  Note that this is not configurable in
Python.  Here we also set the size of the measurement vectors to be 2
components.

Output from the code below:

```none
Frequency of the bin at index [0, 2] is 5 and the bin's instance identifier is 6
```
