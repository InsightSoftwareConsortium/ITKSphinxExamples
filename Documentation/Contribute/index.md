The ITK Sphinx Examples are stored in the [Git] distributed version control system, and
the mainline repository can be found at [ITK Sphinx Examples repository].  Files in
the repository can be edited via the typical {ref}`text editor / version control workflow
<text-editor-submission>` used when modifying source code.

Examples code can be written in the C++ or Python programming languages.
Documentation for the examples is writted in [reStructuredText] / [Sphinx].
Sphinx is a build system that uses the reStructuredText syntax with additional
capabilies, such as multi-document projects and rendering of LaTeX-style
equations.  A good reference for the easy-to-learn reStructuredText syntax is
the [Quick reStructuredText] guide.

There are a variety of ways to take part in the ITK Sphinx Examples project.  All
facets are important to the success of the project.
