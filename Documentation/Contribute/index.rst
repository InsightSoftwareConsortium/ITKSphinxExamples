==========

The ITK Examples are stored in the Git_ distributed version control system, and
the mainline repository can be found at `ITK Examples repository`_.  Files in
the repository can be edited via the typical :ref:`text editor / version control workflow
<text-editor-submission>` used when modifying source code.

Examples code can be written in the C++ or Python programming languages.
Documentation for the examples is writted in reStructuredText_ / Sphinx_.
Sphinx is a build system that uses the reStructuredText syntax with additional
capabilies, such as multi-document projects and rendering of LaTeX-style
equations.  A good reference for the easy-to-learn reStructuredText syntax is
the `Quick reStructuredText`_ guide.

There are a variety of ways to take part in the ITK Examples project.  All
facets are important to the success of the project.
